# Introduction
This depository contains Matlab files used in the manuscript "Regulation of spatio-temporal limits of developmental genes via enhancer grammar"

## Affinity_Analysis_norm_time
This file runs all the analysis and generates all plots except for the Hidden Markov Model data. This code takes image data stored in a .mat file, if you would like access to the .mat file please email Bomyi Lim bomyilim@seas.upenn.edu

## get_HMM_bursts_v4
Function that runs Hidden Markov Model on image data.
## sandbox
This file runs get_HMM_bursts_v4 for each condition and plots the two-state model data
## Signal_Analysis
This file compilied the image data which was then processed by Affinity_Analysis_norm_time
